# MiniShell

The minishell project involves creating a simple UNIX-like shell that can execute commands, manage pipelines, handle redirections, and support environment variables. It includes implementing built-in commands like echo, cd, pwd, export, unset, env, and exit. The shell must display a prompt, maintain a command history, and support interactive controls such as ctrl-C, ctrl-D, and ctrl-\. You must handle single and double quotes, manage the $? variable for exit statuses, and avoid global variables except for signal handling. This project develops skills in process management, inter-process communication, memory handling, and advanced string parsing, closely mimicking bash functionality.
